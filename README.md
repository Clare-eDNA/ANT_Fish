These scripts take you through some of the basic data processing for GBS data
Please note that you'll want to run FastQC and MultiQC before and after demultiplexing to get a good idea of the samples' quality. 
You may also want to optimize little m as well as Big M in the Stacks program, although here we only have a script for optimization of Big M. 

All of these files are tailored to be run under the uoo03666 project on NZ's NeSI server under Clare Adams' username (adacl879). 
Thus, to run these on your own personal computer or your own NeSI account, you will have to change these names.
